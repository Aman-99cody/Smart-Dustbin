# Smart-Dustbin


Designed a Smart Dustbin using Arduino mega microcontroller and ultrasonic sensor.
Once the sensor senses an object in its vicinity of 20 cm , the dustbin opens with help of a servo motor and closes after some delayed time automatically.
It involves an Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor acting as an eye of the dustbin.
A servomotor is also used to open the dustbin by developing adequate tension in the string 
Importance- promoting cleanliness and promotes good hygiene .
My role – Designed the model as well as programmed it.
Challenges faced- Developing enough tension to open the dustbin
Final outcome- Successful opening of the dustbin by sensing any waste within 20 cm vicinity in front of the sensor 
.
